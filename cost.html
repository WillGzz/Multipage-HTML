    <h3>The cost of buying an Am staff depends on many factors such as:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The location of the breeders</li>
        <li>The color</li>
        <li>Gender</li>
        <li>The lineage of the puppy</li>
        <li>The popularity of the breed (supply and demand)</li>
        <li>..and much more!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Oher Factors</h3>
    <p>Another factor that determines the difference in prices between a hundred dollar dog and a thousand dollar dog is
        the registration papers.<br> Depending on what is on the dog's papers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Example: if the dog is a purebred and has certain characteristics related to its past history, the dog will be
        worth more. <br>
        The papers document each dog's past history, but only as long as they are registered.
    </p>

    <h2>Where can I get these registration papers?</h2>
    <p>
        You can get these papers from the dog's breeder if the dog's parents are also registered with the <a
            href="https://www.akc.org/register/" target="_blank">American Kennel Club</a>.
        <br>
        Although there are other registries, many people register dogs with the <a href="https://www.akc.org/register/"
            target="_blank">American Kennel Club</a> because it is the only purebred dog registry in the United States.
    </p>
    <h2>Why get a purebreed dog?</h2>
    <p>Dogs that are mixed could have any variation in temperament and physical characteristics. <br>
        With a purebred dog you will know how it will look and act as it grows into adulthood.</p>

        <h2 >Is the American Staffordshire Terrier a pitbull?</h2>   
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/16/ce/4616ce22542b356e03cf06d00327219a.jpg" alt="bully breeds chart">
        <p>
            Pitbull is a term used in the United States for types of dogs descended from bulldogs and terriers. <br>
            This group includes the:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Am Staf</li>
            <li>American Pit Bull Terrier</li>
            <li>American Bulldog</li>
            <li> Staffordshire Bull Terrier</li>
            <li>American Bully</li>
            <li>Other mixed dogs that may share the same characteristics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In other countries such as the United Kingdom the term pit bull is used as an abbreviation for the American Pit Bull Terrier breed. <br>
        American Pitbull Terrier is the only one with pitbull in its name.  Different countries may use the term differently which in turn causes
        confusion. <br> However these two dogs does do share very similar characteristics.
        </p>

        <p>
            The am staff is very similar to the American Pitbull Terrier in that many consider it to be the same breed. Although the 
            two types of dogs are <br> registered as two different breeds by the Continental Kennel Club. The American kennel club does not 
            recognize the American Pitbull Terrier <br>as a registered breed but does recognize the Am Staff. So people confuse the american pitbull terrier with the am staff.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is the American Pitbull Terrier not a registered breed for the AKC?</h2>
        <p>
            The American kennel club did not recognize the American pitbull terrier as a registered breed <br>
            because it did not want to be associated with dog fighting as a dog registration organization.
