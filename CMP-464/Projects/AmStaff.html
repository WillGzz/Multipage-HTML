        <h2>History of the American Staffordshire Terrier</h2>
        <p>
    The roots of the American Staffordshire Terrier go back to the 18th and 19th centuries in England. Bulldogs and terriers of the time were commonly used in 
    blood sports (dog fighting). The blending of bulldogs and terriers made the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Although the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was used 
    in blood sports. It was also kept as a companion and to defend farms in those days. 
    <br>
    </br>
   Eventually, these dogs came to the United States in the mid 1800s. Breeders of these dogs in the United States created a larger Staffordshire terrier that eventually became a distinct breed of Staffordshire bull terrier, now called the American Staffordshire Terrier. 
 American Staffordshire Terriers were bred to have a calmer and friendlier temperament than their ancestors. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1936. Another name people call the American Staffordshire Terrier is Am Staff or American Staffy.
