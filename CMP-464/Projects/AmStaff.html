        <h2>History of the American Staffordshire Terrier</h2>
        <p>
            The roots of the American Staffordshire Terrier go back to the 18th and 19th centuries in England. Bulldogs
            and terriers of the time were commonly used in
            blood sports (dog fighting). The blending of bulldogs and terriers made the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
            Although the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was used
            in blood sports. It was also kept as a companion and to defend farms in those days.
            <br>
            </br>
            Eventually, these dogs came to the United States in the mid 1800s. Breeders of these dogs in the United
            States created a larger Staffordshire terrier that eventually became a distinct breed of Staffordshire bull
            terrier, now called the American Staffordshire Terrier.
            American Staffordshire Terriers were bred to have a calmer and friendlier temperament than their ancestors.
            The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1936. Another name people call the American Staffordshire
            Terrier is Am Staff or American Staffy.
